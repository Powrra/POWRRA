## Understanding the WRIA 1 Water Rights Adjudication

## What Is a Water Adjudication?

A water rights adjudication is a court process where the state attempts to identify and rank **every** water right in a watershed. In theory, this brings order to competing claims. In practice for WRIA 1, it threatens to subordinate your existing well to claims you've never had to defend against before.

Washington State's Department of Ecology filed this adjudication in Whatcom County Superior Court in **July 2024**, covering the entire Nooksack River Basin (WRIA 1). This affects thousands of property owners with domestic wells, farm irrigation, livestock water, and small businesses.

## Timeline: How We Got Here

**2019** – State legislature directs Ecology to assess the feasibility of adjudication in WRIA 1

**2024 (July)** – Ecology files the adjudication lawsuit in Whatcom County Superior Court, naming the Nooksack Indian Tribe, Lummi Nation, and "all other persons" with potential water rights

**2025 (Early)** – Property owners begin receiving summons in the mail

**2026 (Deadline)** – All claimants must file their water right claims or risk losing them permanently

**Ongoing** – Ecology and tribal governments assert that tribal "trust lands" hold senior federal water rights that override state-permitted and historical well use

## What Does the Summons Mean?

If you received a summons, **you are a party to this lawsuit**. The summons requires you to:

1. File a claim for any water rights you use or own (well, spring, stream diversion, etc.)
2. Meet strict deadlines set by the court
3. Participate in the adjudication process or risk losing your water rights by default

**Key point**: Filing a claim is mandatory to preserve your rights, but **how** you file matters. POWWRA believes property owners should file protective claims **without waiving jurisdictional defenses**—that means preserving your right to challenge whether Ecology and tribal governments even have legal standing to assert these federal "trust land" claims.

## The Core Legal Claims at Issue

Ecology and tribal governments claim:
- The Nooksack Tribe and Lummi Nation hold **senior federal water rights** based on the Point Elliott Treaty of 1855
- These rights apply to "tribal trust lands" managed by tribal governments
- These rights are senior to (trump) all state-based water rights, including your well

**POWWRA's position:**
- The Point Elliott Treaty reserved water rights for **individual Indians on allotted lands**, not corporate tribal governments
- Those individual allotments were later placed under **state and county jurisdiction** by federal law (1906 Burke Act, 1953 Public Law 280, 1887 Dawes Act)
- Ecology's "tribal trust" theory misreads federal law, ignores Supreme Court precedent (Goudy v. Meath, Winters Doctrine, Arizona v. California), and violates Washington State's constitutional water code
- **Property owners have the right to challenge jurisdiction** before being forced into settlement or metering

---

## What This Means for Your Well

If Ecology's theory is accepted without challenge:
- Your domestic or farm well may be ranked "junior" to tribal claims, even if you've used it for 30+ years
- You could be required to install meters, report usage, curtail pumping during dry periods, or even shut down your well
- Your property value will decline because water reliability becomes uncertain
- You may face pressure to settle or "collaborate" without ever getting a court ruling on the validity of the claims

**POWWRA's goal**: Ensure property owners can challenge the legal foundation of these claims **before** accepting subordination.

## What Should You Do?

### 1. Verify if you're affected
- Check if your property is in WRIA 1 (Nooksack Basin): [Link to Whatcom County WRIA map]
- If you have a well, spring, or surface water use, you are likely affected

### 2. Gather your documentation
- Well construction records (well log, driller report, date of completion)
- Water use history (agricultural records, domestic use, property tax records)
- Chain of title and property deeds
- Any pre-1975 records showing historical water use

### 3. Understand your claim options
- You **must** file a claim to preserve your water rights
- POWWRA recommends filing claims that **reserve your right to challenge jurisdiction**
- Consult with an attorney experienced in water law and federal Indian law before filing

### 4. Join the organized defense
- Connect with POWWRA to coordinate legal strategy
- Contribute to the legal defense fund to retain specialized attorneys
- Share information with neighbors and other affected property owners
