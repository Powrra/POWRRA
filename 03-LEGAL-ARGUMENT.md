# LEGAL ARGUMENT & TREATY EVIDENCE
## Why We Challenge Ecology's Tribal Trust Water Rights Theory

---

## Overview

POWWRA contends that the Department of Ecology's assertion of senior federal "tribal trust" water rights for corporate tribal governments is legally unsupported. Our position is based on:

1. The actual text and history of the **Point Elliott Treaty (1855)**
2. Federal law governing **Indian allotments in severalty** (individual ownership)
3. Supreme Court and federal court precedent on **reserved water rights**
4. Washington State's constitutional **water code and jurisdiction**

## The Central Question

**Does the Point Elliott Treaty of 1855 create senior federal water rights for corporate tribal governments on "trust lands" that override state water law and individual property owners' historical well use?**

**POWWRA's answer: No.**

We argue that:
- The treaty reserved water rights for **individual Indians on allotted lands**, not tribal governments as corporate entities
- Those individual allotments were placed under **state and county jurisdiction** by subsequent federal law
- The federal "reserved rights doctrine" (Winters Doctrine) does not extend to modern tribal trust lands in the way Ecology claims
- Property owners have the right to **challenge jurisdiction** before being subordinated to these claims

## Our Legal Foundations

### 1. The Point Elliott Treaty (1855) – Allotments in Severalty

The Point Elliott Treaty, Article 6, states:

> "The President may hereafter, when in his opinion the interests of the Territory may require, and the welfare of the said Indians be promoted, **cause the whole or any portion of the lands hereby reserved to be surveyed into lots, and assign the same to such individuals or families as are willing to avail themselves of the privilege, and will locate on the same as a permanent home**..."

**Our interpretation:**
- The treaty contemplated **individual allotments** to specific Indians and families, not collective tribal government ownership
- Water rights, if reserved, attached to those **individual parcels**, not to a tribal government entity
- These are "allotments in severalty"—individual ownership, not communal trust status

**Key point**: The treaty language does not mention tribal governments holding water rights on behalf of members. It speaks of individual Indians receiving specific parcels.

### 2. Federal Allotment Acts – State Jurisdiction Over Allotted Lands

Congress later formalized the allotment process through several laws:

- **General Allotment Act (Dawes Act, 1887)**: Authorized allotting reservation lands to individual Indians in severalty, with eventual fee-simple ownership
- **Burke Act (1906)**: Provided that allottees who received fee patents would come under **state and territorial laws** and jurisdiction
- **Public Law 280 (1953)**: Extended state civil and criminal jurisdiction over Indian lands in certain states, including Washington

**Our interpretation:**
- Once allotments were patented to individual Indians, those lands and associated water rights came under **state jurisdiction**
- Washington State's water code (developed post-1917) governs water rights on these lands, not federal "trust" status
- Federal reserved rights doctrine does not automatically exempt individual allottees' successors from state water law

---

### 3. Supreme Court Precedent – Winters, Goudy, Arizona v. California

POWWRA relies on established Supreme Court cases that define when and how federal reserved water rights exist:

#### Winters v. United States (1908)
- Established that when the federal government **reserves land for a specific purpose** (like an Indian reservation), it implicitly reserves sufficient water to fulfill that purpose
- **Our reading**: Winters applies to land actually reserved and held in trust **at the time of reservation**, for the purpose stated in the treaty or agreement
- It does not automatically extend to all lands later claimed as "tribal trust" or lands that were allotted to individuals and then brought under state jurisdiction

#### Goudy v. Meath (1906)
- Addressed water rights on individual Indian allotments
- Held that allottees' water rights are determined by **state law**, not federal reserved status, once the land is allotted
- **Our reading**: Supports the argument that individual allotments are subject to state water adjudication, not federal tribal supremacy

#### Arizona v. California (1963)
- Addressed reserved water rights for several tribes along the Colorado River
- Court measured reserved rights based on **practicably irrigable acreage** on the reservation at the time it was created
- **Our reading**: Reserved rights are tied to specific reservation purposes and boundaries at the time of creation, not open-ended claims by tribal governments decades later

**Key takeaway**: Federal reserved rights exist for specific purposes on specific lands. They are not blanket superior rights for all lands a tribal government claims today.

### 4. Washington State Constitutional Water Code (RCW 90)

Washington's water code, established in 1917 and refined over decades, provides:
- Surface and groundwater are public resources managed by the state
- Water rights are allocated by priority date ("first in time, first in right") and beneficial use
- State agencies (Ecology) administer water rights under state law

**Our position:**
- Individual property owners' wells, if established before tribal claims and used beneficially, have **priority under state law**
- Ecology cannot unilaterally subordinate state-based rights to federal claims without **proving** the federal claims are valid
- Property owners have the right to **challenge jurisdiction** in court before being forced into settlement or metering

---

## Why Jurisdiction Matters

POWWRA believes the **first legal question** is:

> **Do Ecology and tribal governments have legal standing to assert federal senior water rights on the lands in question?**

This requires proving:
- Which specific lands are validly held in federal trust status (not just claimed by tribes)
- Whether the Point Elliott Treaty actually reserved water rights for tribal governments (not just individual allottees)
- Whether those rights, if they exist, override state-permitted and historical well use under the McCarran Amendment and state jurisdiction statutes

**We argue**: Property owners should not be forced into "collaboration," metering, or settlement until these threshold jurisdictional questions are resolved by a court.

---

## Our Litigation Strategy

1. **File motions challenging jurisdiction** early in the adjudication process
   - Question whether Ecology has authority to assert federal trust claims
   - Demand proof of trust boundaries and treaty-based standing

2. **Require evidence, not assertions**
   - Tribal governments must prove which specific parcels are in trust
   - They must demonstrate actual historical water use, not just claim seniority

3. **Preserve property owners' defenses**
   - File water right claims that reserve jurisdictional challenges
   - Avoid settling or collaborating in ways that waive the right to contest these claims

4. **Retain experienced counsel**
   - This is complex federal Indian law intersecting with state water law
   - POWWRA is raising funds to hire attorneys with expertise in both areas

## Important Notes

- This summary presents POWWRA's legal theory. It is not legal advice.
- The adjudication is ongoing, and legal arguments will be tested in court.
- Property owners should consult with qualified water rights and federal Indian law attorneys before making legal decisions.
- Our goal is to ensure property owners have the opportunity to **challenge these claims in court** before accepting subordination.
