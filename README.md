## What to Customize

Before publishing, update these placeholders in the content files:

- [ ] **Mailing address**: Add your organization's mailing address for donations
- [ ] **Payment method**: Set up PayPal, Venmo, or check payment instructions
- [ ] **Organizational status**: Clarify if you're a 501(c)(3), 501(c)(4), or informal association (affects tax-deductibility of donations)
- [ ] **PDF links**: Upload your existing PDFs and link to them from the Legal Argument and Resources pages
- [ ] **Attorney approval**: Have your legal counsel review the Legal Argument page before publishing (recommended)

## Content Philosophy

These pages follow your strategic recommendations:

✓ **Simple story for landowners** (Home, What's Happening pages)
✓ **Clear legal argument for attorneys/media** (Legal Argument page)
✓ **Easy next steps** (Join & Donate page with forms and clear actions)

**Tone changes:**
- Separated citations from opinion (Legal Argument page)
- Avoided over-claiming language ("we contend" rather than "this proves")
- Kept content layered (short summaries with links to deeper detail)
- Focused on credibility for legal and media audiences
