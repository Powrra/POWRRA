## How to Edit the Content Later

This HTML file has all content embedded in JavaScript. To change text:

1. Open `index.html` in a text editor (Notepad, VS Code, TextEdit)
2. Find the section you want to change:
   - Search for the text (Ctrl+F or Cmd+F)
   - Edit it directly in the quotes
3. Save the file
4. Re-upload to Netlify/GitHub Pages

**Example:** To change "5,000 GPD" to "6,000 GPD":
- Search for `current: 5000`
- Change to `current: 6000`
- Save and re-upload

## Updating Content from My .md Files

The HTML file currently has different content than the .md files I created. If you want to use MY content (the detailed legal argument, timeline, etc.) in THIS design, I can help you merge them.

## RECOMMENDATION

**Use Netlify** - it's the absolute fastest way to get this live:
1. Save HTML as `index.html`
2. Drag to Netlify
3. You're live in 2 minutes

Then you can point your powwra.org domain to it later.
