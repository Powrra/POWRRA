## DECISION MADE: WORDPRESS

You chose **WordPress** because:
✅ Multiple people will manage the site (mixed tech skills)
✅ Monthly updates needed (case news, events)
✅ Need easy donation management
✅ Want visual editing (not code editing)
✅ Need professional credibility for attorneys/media

**This was the right choice for your needs.**

---

## YOUR NEXT STEP RIGHT NOW

**Open this file:**
👉 **WORDPRESS-IMPLEMENTATION-PLAN.md**

**Read Phase 1** and create your WordPress.com account today.

**It will take you 15 minutes** and then you'll have a working WordPress site.

## DONATION SETUP

Once WordPress is running, set up donations:

**Open this file:**
👉 **DONATION-SETUP-GUIDE.md**

**Follow the steps for:**
1. Stripe (professional, accepts all cards)
2. Venmo (quick donations from locals)

**Time needed:** 15-20 minutes

---

## CONTENT STRATEGY RECAP

Your new site addresses the 3 core needs you identified:

### 1. ✅ Simple Story for Landowners
**Home page** and **What's Happening page** explain:
- The threat (Ecology's adjudication and tribal trust claims)
- What it means for your well (5,000 → 350 GPD)
- What you should do (gather documents, join, contribute)

**Tone:** Accessible, factual, action-oriented

### 2. ✅ Clear Legal Argument for Attorneys/Media
**Legal Argument page** provides:
- Direct treaty quotes (Point Elliott Treaty)
- 10+ Supreme Court case citations (Winters, Goudy, Arizona v. California, etc.)
- Analysis of federal allotment acts (Dawes, Burke, PL 280)
- Jurisdictional theory explained
- Full brief download

**Tone:** Professional, evidence-based, credible

### 3. ✅ Easy Next Steps for Joining/Funding
**Join & Donate page** offers:
- Clear explanation of what funds support
- Two donation methods (Stripe + Venmo)
- Contact form to join
- Transparency commitments
- Multiple ways to help (volunteer, share story, donate)

**Tone:** Trustworthy, transparent, urgent but not desperate

---

## STRENGTHS OF THIS APPROACH

### Content Quality
✅ Based directly on your 3 PDFs (treaty analysis, legal theory, strategy)
✅ Separated citations from opinion (more credible)
✅ Avoided over-claiming language (professional tone)
✅ Layered content (short summaries + deep dives)

### Functionality

✅ Contact form for joining/organizing
✅ Transparency about fund use
✅ Printable handout for offline outreach

### Credibility
✅ Will satisfy attorneys evaluating your legal theory
✅ Will satisfy journalists researching the story
✅ Will help landowners understand what's at stake
✅ Legal disclaimer protects you

### Maintainability
✅ WordPress = easy for multiple people to update
✅ No coding required for monthly case updates
✅ Donation system ready to go
