# 🚀 Get Your Site Online in 5 Minutes (No GitHub Required!)

**Choose your path:**

---

## Path 1: I Want the CMS (editing interface)

**Requirements:** GitHub account needed

👉 **Follow these guides in order:**
1. `GITHUB-SETUP.md` - Create account & upload code (10 min)
2. `NETLIFY-EASY-SETUP.md` - Method 2 (5 min)

**Result:** Site + CMS admin panel where anyone can edit

---

## Path 2: Just Get It Online NOW (Easiest!)

**No GitHub. No setup. Just drag and drop.**

### Step 1: Create a Zip File

1. Open **Finder**
2. Navigate to: `/Users/allie/projects/Water`
3. Select these folders/files (hold Cmd and click each):
   - `admin` folder
   - `content` folder
   - `index.html`
   - `netlify.toml`
4. **Right-click** → **"Compress 4 items"**
5. Rename the zip to: `powwra-site.zip`

### Step 2: Upload to Netlify Drop

1. Open browser: https://app.netlify.com/drop
2. **Drag** `powwra-site.zip` onto the page
3. Wait 30 seconds... ⏳
4. **DONE!** ✅

Your site is now live at: `https://something-random-123.netlify.app`

### Step 3: (Optional) Claim Your Site

1. Click "Claim site" on the page
2. Sign up for free Netlify account (just email)
3. Rename URL to something better like `powwra`

**Note:** The CMS admin panel won't work with this method (needs GitHub).

**To edit content:** Just edit the JSON files in `/content` folder and re-upload the zip.

## Questions?

**Q: Can I switch from Path 2 to Path 1 later?**
A: Yes! You can always set up GitHub later.

**Q: How do I edit content with Path 2?**
A: Edit files in `/content` folder, make new zip, re-upload to Netlify.

**Q: Is Path 1 hard?**
A: Not really! `GITHUB-SETUP.md` has step-by-step instructions with pictures.

**My recommendation:** Start with Path 2 to see it live, then do Path 1 when ready.
