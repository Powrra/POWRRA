## ⚠️ YOUR WELL IS AT RISK

If you own property with a well in Whatcom County's Nooksack Basin (WRIA 1), a lawsuit has been filed that could:

- ✗ Rank your existing well as **"junior"** to tribal government claims
- ✗ Require **metering, reporting**, and possible shut-downs during dry periods
- ✗ **Reduce property value** due to water uncertainty
- ✗ Force you into settlement **without testing legal claims** in court

**The Core Claim:** Ecology and tribal governments assert senior federal water rights dating back to the 1855 Point Elliott Treaty that trump your historical well use.

---

## WHY WE CHALLENGE THIS

**POWWRA's Position: The state's claim is legally and historically false.**

- **Individual Rights:** 1855 Treaty allotted lands to individual Indians, not corporate tribal governments.
- **State Jurisdiction:** Federal laws (Burke Act, PL 280) placed allotted lands under state/county jurisdiction.
- **Supreme Court Precedent:** Cases (Goudy v. Meath, Winters v. US) don't support blanket tribal trust claims.
- **No Proof:** Ecology has not proven which specific lands are validly held in federal trust status today.

**Legal Authorities We Rely On:**
Point Elliott Treaty (1855) • Dawes Act (1887) • Burke Act (1906) • Winters v. US (1908) • Goudy v. Meath (1906) • Arizona v. California (1963) • Public Law 280 (1953) • McCarran Amendment • WA State Water Code (RCW 90.03 & 90.44)
