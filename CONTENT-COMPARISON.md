## DETAILED COMPARISON

### 1. HOMEPAGE / HERO SECTION

**HTML Version:**
```
"Property Owners Well Water Rights Alliance"
"We can stand up and fight for our Constitutional rights."
```
- Simple, emotional appeal
- No explanation of what the threat actually is
- Good call-to-action buttons

**My Version (01-HOME-PAGE.md):**
```
"Defending Our Wells and Property Rights in WRIA 1"

Property owners in Whatcom County's Nooksack Basin (WRIA 1) face an
unprecedented threat to their existing wells, farms, and land values.
The Washington Department of Ecology has filed a massive water rights
adjudication claiming that tribal governments hold senior "trust land"
water rights that could override your historical well use...

We believe this claim is legally and historically false.
```
- Specific, factual explanation
- Identifies the exact threat (DOE adjudication, tribal trust claims)
- States your legal position clearly
- Professional tone suitable for media/attorneys

**WINNER:** My version - more informative, credible, specific

---

### 2. "WHO ARE WE" SECTION

**HTML Version:**
```
"We are property owners with water rights that we have historically
enjoyed on our land. We have been sued.

The subpoenas (35,000) were initiated by the Lummi and Nooksack tribal
governments, who are claiming superior and preferential rights over each
of us as landowners."
```
- Emotional ("we have been sued")
- Limited explanation
- No legal foundation provided

**My Version (from 01-HOME-PAGE.md):**
```
The Core Problem:

Ecology claims:
- Tribal governments have senior federal water rights on "trust lands"
  that trump all other uses
- These rights come from the Point Elliott Treaty of 1855
- Property owners must prove their wells don't impair these tribal claims

Our position:
- Treaty-reserved water rights were created for individual Indian allottees,
  not corporate tribal governments
- These individual allotments were later placed under state jurisdiction
  by federal law
- Ecology's "tribal trust seniority" theory misreads the treaty, federal
  law, and Supreme Court precedent
```
- Clearly states both sides of the argument
- Introduces legal foundation (treaty, allotments, jurisdiction)
- Professional tone, not emotional
- Sets up the legal argument that follows

**WINNER:** My version - much more credible and informative

---

### 3. THE 5,000 → 350 GALLON THREAT

**HTML Version:**
```
[Visual showing 5,000 GPD → 350 GPD with dramatic red alert styling]

"The tribal governments are requesting an increase of all surface and
ground water allocation by up to 50%. Adjudication will reduce our
allocation to provide for their claims."
```
- ✅ **Excellent visual impact**
- ✅ **Clear, dramatic presentation**
- Good for emotional engagement
- Limited context on *why* this would happen

**My Version:**
```
If Ecology's theory stands:
- Your existing domestic, farm, or business well could be deemed "junior"
  to tribal claims
- You may be forced to meter, curtail, or abandon wells you've used for decades
- Your property value will decline because reliable water access is uncertain
- Settlement pressure will force you to accept limitations without ever
  testing the legal claims in court
```
- More detailed consequences
- Explains the *mechanism* (junior rights, metering, settlement pressure)
- Less dramatic visually, but more thorough

**WINNER:** TIE - HTML's visual is powerful, my text adds important context

---

### 4. LEGAL ARGUMENT / "DEFENSE" SECTION

**HTML Version:**
```
"Our Legal Choice: Hiring expert national counsel to answer three vital questions."

1. What are our individual legal water rights?
2. What authority does the WA State Department of Ecology have?
3. Do the Tribal Governments have preferential or legal authority over
   well property owners?

"With the help of a Federal attorney, we can petition the court to recognize
historic, legal records and Constitutional jurisdiction. We contend that these
tribal governments do not have preferential authority over well property
owners whose rights were established in severalty."
```
- Surface-level questions
- Mentions "severalty" (good!) but doesn't explain it
- **No case law citations**
- **No treaty text**
- **No discussion of Winters, Goudy, Arizona v. California, McCarran, etc.**
- Would not satisfy an attorney or journalist researching your claims

**My Version (03-LEGAL-ARGUMENT.md):**
```
POWWRA contends that the Department of Ecology's assertion of senior
federal "tribal trust" water rights for corporate tribal governments is
legally unsupported. Our position is based on:

1. The actual text and history of the Point Elliott Treaty (1855)
2. Federal law governing Indian allotments in severalty (individual ownership)
3. Supreme Court and federal court precedent on reserved water rights
4. Washington State's constitutional water code and jurisdiction

[Then provides detailed sections on:]

1. The Point Elliott Treaty (1855) – Allotments in Severalty
   - Direct treaty quotes
   - Analysis of "in severalty" language
   - Distinction between individual allotments and tribal government ownership

2. Federal Allotment Acts – State Jurisdiction Over Allotted Lands
   - General Allotment Act (Dawes Act, 1887)
   - Burke Act (1906)
   - Public Law 280 (1953)
   - Analysis of how these placed allotted lands under state jurisdiction

3. Supreme Court Precedent – Winters, Goudy, Arizona v. California
   - Full case citations
   - Key quotes from decisions
   - Analysis of how they apply to your situation

4. Washington State Constitutional Water Code (RCW 90)
   - Explains state water law framework
   - Priority date system ("first in time, first in right")
   - Your argument for state jurisdiction

[Plus sections on:]
- Why Jurisdiction Matters
- Our Litigation Strategy (specific motions, evidence requirements)
- Complete case law list with citations
- Download link to full brief
```
- **10+ case citations with analysis**
- **Direct treaty quotes**
- **Statutory citations (RCW, USC)**
- **Professional legal writing style**
- **Detailed enough for attorneys to evaluate your theory**
- **Accessible enough for educated landowners**

**WINNER:** My version by a LANDSLIDE - this is not even close. The HTML version would not be taken seriously by attorneys, judges, or investigative journalists. Mine is credible and thorough.

- ✅ **Excellent interactive visual**
