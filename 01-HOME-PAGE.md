## Headline
**Defending Our Wells and Property Rights in WRIA 1**

---

## Main Message (Top of Page)

Property owners in Whatcom County's Nooksack Basin (WRIA 1) face an unprecedented threat to their existing wells, farms, and land values. The Washington Department of Ecology has filed a massive water rights adjudication claiming that tribal governments hold senior "trust land" water rights that could override your historical well use—even wells that have supplied your family or farm for decades.

**We believe this claim is legally and historically false.**

The Property Owners Water Well Rights Advocates (POWWRA) is organizing landowners to challenge Ecology's jurisdiction and defend our constitutional water rights. We're not fighting against proper water management—we're fighting to ensure that property owners aren't stripped of rights they've relied on for generations based on a flawed legal theory.

## The Core Problem

Ecology claims:
- Tribal governments have senior federal water rights on "trust lands" that trump all other uses
- These rights come from the Point Elliott Treaty of 1855
- Property owners must prove their wells don't impair these tribal claims

**Our position:**
- Treaty-reserved water rights were created for **individual Indian allottees**, not corporate tribal governments
- These individual allotments were later placed under **state jurisdiction** by federal law
- Ecology's "tribal trust seniority" theory misreads the treaty, federal law, and Supreme Court precedent
- **We must challenge jurisdiction first** before being forced into "collaboration" that assumes these claims are valid

## What's At Stake

If Ecology's theory stands:
- Your existing domestic, farm, or business well could be deemed "junior" to tribal claims
- You may be forced to meter, curtail, or abandon wells you've used for decades
- Your property value will decline because reliable water access is uncertain
- Settlement pressure will force you to accept limitations without ever testing the legal claims in court

**We believe property owners deserve their day in court** to challenge these claims before surrendering rights.

## Our Strategy

1. **Challenge jurisdiction**: File motions questioning whether Ecology and tribal governments have legal standing to assert these federal trust-based claims
2. **Demand proof**: Require Ecology and tribes to prove trust boundaries, treaty basis, and actual water use—not just assert claims
3. **Organize landowners**: Build a unified coalition to fund experienced water rights attorneys and expert witnesses
4. **Preserve rights**: Help property owners file protective claims without waiving jurisdictional defenses
