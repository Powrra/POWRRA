# JOIN THE DEFENSE FUND
## Organize, Fund Legal Action, Defend Our Water Rights

---

## Why We Need Your Support

Challenging Ecology's water rights theory requires experienced legal counsel, expert witnesses, documentary research, and coordinated advocacy. We cannot win this fight alone or on a shoestring budget.

**The adjudication will proceed with or without organized landowner defense.** If property owners do not coordinate and fund a strong legal challenge, Ecology and tribal governments will face little resistance to their claims—and your well will be subordinated by default.
