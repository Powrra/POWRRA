# WRIA 1 WATER RIGHTS ADJUDICATION
## What Property Owners Need to Know

**Property Owners Water Well Rights Advocates (POWWRA)**

---

## YOUR WELL IS AT RISK

If you own property with a well in Whatcom County's Nooksack Basin (WRIA 1), the Washington Department of Ecology has filed a lawsuit that could:

✗ Rank your existing well as "junior" to tribal government claims
✗ Require metering, reporting, and possible shut-downs during dry periods
✗ Reduce your property value due to water uncertainty
✗ Force you into settlement without testing the legal claims in court

**You have the right to challenge these claims—but only if you act.**

---

## WHAT'S HAPPENING?

**July 2024**: Ecology filed a massive water rights adjudication covering all of WRIA 1

**2025**: Property owners receiving summons in the mail

**2026**: Deadline to file water right claims or lose them forever

**The Core Claim**: Ecology and tribal governments assert that tribal trust lands hold senior federal water rights that trump your historical well use, based on the Point Elliott Treaty (1855).

**POWWRA's Position**: This claim is legally and historically false.

## WHY WE CHALLENGE ECOLOGY'S THEORY

1. **The Treaty Reserved Water for Individual Indians, Not Tribal Governments**
   - Point Elliott Treaty (1855) allotted lands to individual Indians "in severalty" (individual ownership)
   - Water rights, if reserved, attached to those individual parcels—not corporate tribal governments

2. **Federal Law Placed Allotments Under State Jurisdiction**
   - Burke Act (1906), Public Law 280 (1953), and other laws placed allotted lands under state and county jurisdiction
   - Washington's water code governs these rights, not federal "trust" claims

3. **Supreme Court Precedent Limits Reserved Rights**
   - *Goudy v. Meath* (1906): Individual allottees' water rights determined by state law
   - *Winters Doctrine* (1908): Reserved rights tied to specific reservation purposes at time of creation
   - Tribal governments cannot assert open-ended superior rights decades later without proof

4. **Property Owners Have Constitutional Rights**
   - You have the right to challenge jurisdiction before being subordinated
   - Ecology must **prove** trust boundaries and treaty-based standing—not just assert it

## HOW POWWRA IS FIGHTING BACK

**Our Strategy:**
1. Challenge jurisdiction **first** (file motions questioning Ecology's legal authority)
2. Demand proof of trust boundaries and treaty-based standing
3. Retain experienced attorneys in water rights and federal Indian law
4. Organize property owners for coordinated legal defense

**We Need:**
- Funding for attorneys, expert witnesses, and documentary research
- Landowners willing to stand together in court
- Public and legislative pressure on Ecology to prove its claims
